# Saving Time in the Container Unloading Process - A Case Study in Warehouse Logistics
## Data Analysis Project 

Thanks for dropping by! This repository hosts the files for my case study.
You'll find the condensed findings as a report in the file **Full Report.pdf**. It contains hyperlinks to all data and code files used in the report.
In case you are interested in the individual files, the data sources are:

- rawDataContainerUnloading2019v1.xlsx (data containing the unaltered data just after I manually entered it into Excel)
- rawDataContainerUnloading2019v2.xlsx (this file is slightly altered and made ready for cleaning in *R*)
- changelogRawDataContainerUnloading2019v2.txt (all important changes made in Excel)
- core_data_v3.csv (data made ready for analysis in *R*)

For data cleaning in *R* the individual files are:

- dataCleaning.R (just the code)
- dataCleaningMarkdown.Rmd (R markdown with code and output)
- dataCleaningMarkdown.pdf (knitted R markdown file, nice to read)

For data analysis in *R* the individual files are:

- dataAnalysis.R (just the code)
- dataAnalysisMarkdown.Rmd (R markdown with code and output)
- dataAnalysisMarkdown.pdf (knitted R markdown file, nice to read)

Should you want to run the code you need to make sure that you download all source files into the same folder and change the filepaths in the code accoding to the filepath on your machine.

## Tasks
